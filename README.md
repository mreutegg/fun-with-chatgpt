> Write a Java program that contradicts itself

It is not possible to write a Java program that contradicts itself. A program is a set of instructions that are executed in a specific order. If a program contains a contradiction, it will either not compile or it will produce an error when it is run.

For example, the following Java code will not compile because it contains a contradiction:
```
public class Contradiction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        if (x > 5) {
            System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
        } else {
            System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
        }
    }
}
```
The if statement in this code contradicts itself because it says that if x is greater than 5, it will print one message, but if x is not greater than 5, it will print a different message. Since x is equal to 5, both conditions cannot be true at the same time. This code will produce a compiler error because it contains a contradiction.
